# 🧠 Testing ChatGPT Prompts for Consistency and Accuracy

This project explores how different prompt styles (Direct, Instructional, and Contextual) affect the accuracy, creativity, and consistency of ChatGPT’s responses.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To evaluate and compare how prompt design influences output quality and response reliability in generative AI models.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Selected a simple use case — generating product descriptions.
2. Tested three prompt styles:
   - **A. Direct:** "Write a product description for wireless earbuds."
   - **B. Instructional:** "You are a professional copywriter. Write a 3-sentence product description focusing on sound and battery life."
   - **C. Contextual:** "Imagine you’re writing for Amazon. Create an engaging and informative product description focusing on comfort, battery life, and sound."
3. Rated responses manually (1–5 scale) for:
   - Accuracy
   - Creativity
   - Consistency
