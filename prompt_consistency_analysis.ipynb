# 🧠 Project: Testing ChatGPT Prompts for Consistency and Accuracy
# Author: Priyanshu Raj
# Goal: Compare ChatGPT responses for 3 prompt styles (Direct, Instructional, Contextual)

import pandas as pd

# Step 1. Define test prompts
prompts = {
    "Direct": "Write a product description for wireless earbuds.",
    "Instructional": "You are a professional copywriter. Write a 3-sentence product description for wireless earbuds focusing on sound and battery life.",
    "Contextual": "Imagine you’re writing for Amazon. Create an engaging and informative product description for wireless earbuds focusing on comfort, battery life, and sound performance."
}

# Step 2. Simulated responses (you can paste real ChatGPT responses here)
responses = {
    "Direct": "Wireless earbuds deliver clear sound and deep bass. Compact design with reliable Bluetooth connection.",
    "Instructional": "Experience studio-quality sound with our wireless earbuds. Enjoy 24-hour battery life and ergonomic comfort. Perfect for work, travel, and workouts.",
    "Contextual": "Designed for long hours of comfort, these wireless earbuds offer crisp audio, punchy bass, and 30 hours of playtime. Ideal for commuters and fitness lovers alike."
}

# Step 3. Create a DataFrame for manual scoring
data = {
    "Prompt Type": ["Direct", "Instructional", "Contextual"],
    "Accuracy": [3.5, 4.0, 4.5],
    "Creativity": [3.0, 4.2, 4.8],
    "Consistency": [4.0, 4.5, 4.6]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df["Average Score"] = df[["Accuracy", "Creativity", "Consistency"]].mean(axis=1)
print(df)

# Step 4. Visualize results
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
plt.bar(df["Prompt Type"], df["Average Score"])
plt.title("Prompt Performance Comparison")
plt.ylabel("Average Score (1–5)")
plt.xlabel("Prompt Type")
plt.grid(axis="y", linestyle="--", alpha=0.6)
plt.show()

# Step 5. Conclusion
best_prompt = df.loc[df["Average Score"].idxmax(), "Prompt Type"]
print(f"✅ Context-rich prompts (‘{best_prompt}’) produced the best results (~30% better).")
